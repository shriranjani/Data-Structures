# Data-Structures and Algorithms
  1) A data structure is a storage or named location that can be used to store and organize data. It is a method to arrange data on a computer in an organized way so that the data can be retrieved, accessed or updated in a easy and efficient manner. Eg : Array, Hash table etc
  2) An algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Eg : Searching (Binary, Linear), Sorting (Quick, Merge) etc.
  
  Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.
  
  **Two types:**
  1) **Linear Data Structure** : Data Structure in which the data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where each element is attached to it's previous or next adjacent elements is called a linear data structure.
       1) **Static** : Fixed memory size. Easy to access Eg : Array
       2) **Dynamic** : Size is not fixed. Dynamically updated during the run time which can be considered efficient concerning the space compexity Eg : Stack, Queue.
  3) **Non Linear Data Structure** : Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run. Eg : Trees, Graphs
