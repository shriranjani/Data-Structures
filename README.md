# Data-Structures
  1) A data structure is a storage or named location that can be used to store and organize data. It is a method to arrange data on a computer in an organized way so that the data can be retrieved, accessed or updated in a easy and efficient manner. 
  2) An algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. 
  
  Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.
  
  **Two types:**
    1) Linear Data Structure.
    2) Non Linear Data Structure.
  
  **Linear Data Structure** : Data Structure in which the data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where each element is attached to it's previous or next adjacent elements is called a linear data structure.
  **Non Linear Data Structure** : Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run.
